## Builds
If you only want to install and run the latest public releases, we will continue to post them here:

[TARILIO](https://tarilio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TARILIO-RELEASE-1-1-9452-28652.zip)  1.1.9452 (Released 17 Nov 2025)

[TARILIO Portable](https://tarilio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TARILIO-PORTABLE-1-1-9452-29775.zip) 1.1.9452 (Released 17 Nov 2025)

NOTE: eSearch Pro and Portable version 1.1.9439 (04 November 2025) will be the last builds that use the 'eSearch' working title. Future open source versions will use the TARILIO brand, the commercially licensed version will continue to be named TARILIO PRO.

NOTE: eSearch Pro and Portable versions 1.1.9288 (6 June 2025) and earlier revert to eSearch Lite after 30 days. Later versions under the open-source license no longer require a serial number and will continue to remain fully functional and free of charge for private, non-commercial use or commercial 30-day evaluation use.

TARILIO PRO versions contain additional closed-source code and are for commercial use. They require a serial number or will revert to a TARILIO Lite version after 30-days, they also revert after 1 year unless the license/serial is renewed. You can evaluate using the eSearch/TARILO versions above, and install the TARILIO PRO version later, it will recognise your configurations, saved settings, indexes, etc.
