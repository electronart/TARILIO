## Builds
If you only want to install and run the latest public releases of eSearch Pro and eSearch Portable, we will continue to post them here:

[eSearch Pro](https://dtsearch.co.uk/news/product/esearch-pro/)  1.1.9337 (Released 25 July 2025)

[eSearch Portable](https://dtsearch.co.uk/news/product/esearch-portable/) 1.1.9336 (Released 24 July 2025)

NOTE: eSearch Pro and Portable versions 1.1.9288 (6 June 2025) and earlier revert to eSearch Lite after 30 days. Later versions under the open-source license no longer require a serial number and will continue to remain fully functional and free of charge for private, non-commercial use or commercial 30-day evaluation use.

TARILIO versions contain additional closed-source code and are for commercial use. They require a serial number or will revert to Lite after 30-days, they also revert to Lite mode after 1 year unless the license/serial is renewed. You can evaluate using the eSearch versions above, and install the TARILIO version later, it will recognise your eSearch configurations, saved settings, indexes, etc.

[TARILIO Pro](https://dtsearch.co.uk/news/product/tarilio-pro/) 1.1.9337 (Released 25 July 2025)
