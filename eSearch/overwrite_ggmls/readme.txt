I couldn't get the visual studio installer project to pick up the right DLL's

I spent too much time trying to figure out why it is not resolving correctly. This is a HACK

These files are the correct ggml files that go in the main eSearch installation folder.
They will be used to overwrite the incorrectly written dlls.
